### About me

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at **[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)** studying computer science and math.

I'm also a Software Engineer at **[CreativeMode (YC S24)](https://creativemode.net/)**, where I'm building coding agents for gaming.

I'm passionate about using **AI to lower barriers for creative expression.**

### About this repo

This site is a **Three.js interactive game** (TypeScript + Vite) with:

- **3D rendering** via `three`
- **Physics** via `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat` (with a post-build WASM copy step)
- **Hand tracking** via MediaPipe (`@mediapipe/hands`)

Core code lives in `src/` (rendering, player controls, interactions, and world content).

### Acknowledgments

- **Inspiration**: This project was inspired by Bruno Simon's amazing portfolio, [bruno-simon.com](https://bruno-simon.com/).
- **AI**: I used **Cursor** to assist with building this site.

npm install
npm run dev
