This project made heavy use of AI assistance, and was created for CMU 15-113, a course on learning to effectively use AI in coding workflows.

# Initial Prototype
The initial prototype was essentially vibe-coded, using an llm to generate a detailed plan. I had the overall vision for the project, and just needed help researching libraries and overall tech stack that would be appropriate.

- I used (web) ChatGPT to generate the plan for the project
- I used Cursor in Agent Mode to generate the starter code for the project, using the plan as a prompt
- I continued to use Cursor Agent Mode with new chats to debug certain issues I found with rendering and deployments
