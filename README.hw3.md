# API Usage

I am using Puter.js to generate images using Nano Banana.
As input, I provide a system prompt found in `src/interaction/prompts.ts`,
along with a reference image taken by the user. This requires no API key. Given
these inputs, the API returns an AI generated image that looks like a caricature drawn in black marker on white paper.
